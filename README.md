# Git HTTP Backend

This is a Go based implementation of Grack (a Rack application), which aimed 
to replace the builtin git-http-backed CGI handler distributed with C Git. 
Grack was written to allow far more webservers to handle Git smart http 
requests. The aim of this project is to improve Git smart http performance by 
utilising the power of Go.
